<h3Special and General Theory of Relativity
<dl>
<dt>Special Theory of Relativity (1905)</dt>
<dd>Albert Einstein introduced special relativity to describe how space and time behave when objects move close to the speed of light. This theory applies to situations without gravity and is based on two main principles:
</dd>
<ol type="1">  
<li>The speed of light is constant – No matter how fast an observer moves, light always travels at the same speed (approximately 299,792 km/s).</li>  
<li>Relativity of time and space – Time slows down for moving objects, and distances appear shorter for them. This is known as ,time dilation and length contraction respectively. </li> 
</ol>
<br>
One of the most famous results of special relativity is E = mc², which shows that mass and energy are interchangeable. This principle explains nuclear reactions and the immense energy released by atomic processes.  

<dt>General Theory of Relativity (1915) </dt>
<dd>Einstein expanded special relativity to incorporate gravity, leading to general relativity. Instead of treating gravity as a force (as Newton did), Einstein described it as the curvature of spacetime caused by mass. The key ideas are:
</dd>
<ol type="i">  
<li>Spacetime bends around massive objects – Large masses like planets and stars distort spacetime, affecting how other objects move. </li> 
<li>Gravitational time dilation – Clocks run slower in stronger gravitational fields. For example, time moves slower near black holes compared to Earth.</li>  
<li>Gravitational waves – When massive objects (like black holes) collide, they create ripples in spacetime, which have been detected by observatories like LIGO. </li> 
<li>Black holes – Extremely dense objects where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape.</li>  
</ol>
<dd>General relativity has been experimentally confirmed and plays a crucial role in understanding cosmology, predicting black holes, and explaining the expansion of the universe. Despite its success, scientists are still trying to unify it with quantum mechanics.

<dt>Relativity and GPS Technology</dt>
<br>
<dd>One of the most practical applications of relativity in our everyday lives is the Global Positioning System (GPS). GPS satellites orbit the Earth, providing precise location data used for navigation in cars, planes, and smartphones. However, these satellites operate in a different time frame compared to us on the ground.</dd>

<dd>Special Relativity tells us that time moves slower for objects in motion. GPS satellites, travelling at high speeds, experience time slightly differently than we do. Additionally, General Relativity explains that clocks closer to massive objects (like Earth) tick slower than those further away. GPS satellites, being farther from Earth’s gravitational pull, experience a faster passage of time.</dd>

<dd>To maintain accuracy, the GPS system must account for these time discrepancies caused by both Special and General Relativity. Without these adjustments, GPS devices would be inaccurate by about 10 kilometres per day.</dd>
<br>

<dt>Particle Accelerators and Medical Imaging</dt>
<br>
<dd>Relativity also plays a crucial role in particle accelerators, which are used in both research and medical applications. In particle accelerators, particles are sped up to nearly the speed of light. According to Special Relativity, as these particles approach light speed, their mass effectively increases, requiring more and more energy to continue accelerating.</dd>

<dd>This principle is harnessed in medical technologies like PET (Positron Emission Tomography) scans. PET scans detect gamma rays emitted by a radioactive substance in the body, helping doctors diagnose conditions like cancer. The technology relies on principles of particle physics, underpinned by relativity, to provide accurate imaging.</dd>
<br>

<dt>The Fabric of the Universe</dt>
<br>
<dd>Einstein’s theory of General Relativity has fundamentally changed our understanding of the universe. It predicts phenomena such as black holes, which are regions of space where gravity is so intense that not even light can escape. The bending of light around massive objects, known as gravitational lensing, allows astronomers to observe distant galaxies and study the structure of the cosmos.</dd>
<br>

<dd>Moreover, General Relativity has led to the discovery of gravitational waves—ripples in spacetime caused by violent astrophysical events like colliding black holes. These waves provide a new way of observing the universe, opening up exciting possibilities for future research.</dd>
<br>

<dt>Learning Relativity at Cambridge Global Classes</dt>
<br>
<dd>At Cambridge Global Classes, we believe that understanding the principles of relativity can inspire students to appreciate the beauty and complexity of the universe. Our experienced educators, who are graduates of Stanford and IITs, strive to make challenging concepts like relativity accessible and engaging.</dd>

Newton’s law of universal gravitation isn’t necessarily “wrong,” but it is incomplete. It works well for most everyday situations, like calculating planetary motion or engineering structures, but fails in extreme conditions, such as near very strong gravitational fields or when dealing with objects moving close to the speed of light.

Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity expanded upon Newton’s work by showing that gravity isn’t just a force between masses—it’s actually the curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy. 
<br>
<br>
This explains phenomena that Newton’s law couldn’t, such as:
<ul>
<li> Mercury’s orbit – Newtonian gravity couldn’t fully predict Mercury’s path around the Sun, but general relativity corrected the discrepancy.
<li> Gravitational waves – Ripples in spacetime caused by massive accelerating objects, confirmed by LIGO.</li>
<li>Gravitational lensing – Light bends around massive objects, proving spacetime distortion.</li>
<li> Black holes – Regions of extreme gravity that Newton’s equations couldn’t predict.
While Newton’s equations are still widely used for practical calculations, they are considered an approximation of a deeper reality described by Einstein. </li>
</ul>
